# hello-world-
practice repository 

I'm leaning to code on my own and I'm just starting to use github to get some activity going with algorithm.

I have learned Javascript and now i plan to learn HTML and CSS for front end web development.  Then i will start learning back end developmnet.  I also want to learn how to make apps for phones.
